Totally new to github, but use fullcalendar heavily.
Not Sure where to post my question, but is there a support\chat forum?, an easy way to see what features users have added?
- When will changes get merged with the master?
- Has anyone managed to include an icon in a appointment?

Again sorry for posting this here, but seems a lack of community, or im prob just not looking in the right place!
