Totally new to github, but use fullcalendar heavily.
Not Sure where to post my question, but is there a support\chat forum?, an easy way to see what features users have added?
- When will changes get merged with the master?
- Has anyone managed to include an icon in a appointment?

Again sorry for posting this here, but seems a lack of community, or im prob just not looking in the right place!

You should contact Adam Shaw, the original author of FullCalendar, but it appears he did not include any new feature or bug fix (check the many pull requests with no answer) for a while now.
What would be nice from him would be to officially state that FullCalendar is looking for a new maintainer.
