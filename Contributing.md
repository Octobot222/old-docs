Do you want to help the FullCalendar project move forward? FullCalendar has become rather popular over the past few years and there is a lot to be done. Any time and effort you are willing to contribute is greatly appreciated! Here are the ways you can contribute:


## Answering StackOverflow Questions

FullCalendar has a lot of configuration options and some complex behavior, and often times people need help achieving what they want. FullCalendar uses StackOverflow as a support forum. If you have experience with FullCalendar, answering other peoples' questions is a great way to contribute.

Visit the [StackOverflow **fullcalendar** tag](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/tagged/fullcalendar)


## Writing Code

The project welcomes bugfixes and features.
[Instructions for contributing code &raquo;](https://github.com/fullcalendar/fullcalendar/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md)

There are two particular projects needing attention: removing jQuery as a dependency and converting the codebase to TypeScript. [More information &raquo;](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLScEQ8XcIvH-HEvepvqnOdFq2-hGW3iPK3yB9QN6XW56JOmO8g/viewform)


## Issue Tracker Triage

The issue tracker gets submissions that are often not very useful in their initial form. They need to be fleshed out in some way:

- A bug that is not fully reproducable. The submitter needs help following the [bug report instructions](Reporting-Bugs).
- A feature request that is not sufficiently described, according to the [feature request instructions](Requesting-Features)
- A report that already exists and should be marked as "Duplicate". This is not as easy as it sounds, as there are hundreds of issues!
- An issue that is not really an issue and should be marked as "Invalid". Example: a question that should be asked on StackOverflow instead.

The goal is to make every issue *actionable*, so that its need is established and its implementation clear.

## Improving the Docs

The documentation needs some love, especially with providing examples. [A paid position is available &raquo;](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSdDXiO7DswqqLqLtyPaQ2puIsGhLZrfX828MFCOEwL6lgqmxQ/viewform)
