Say you've found a bug with FullCalendar and want to contribute a bugfix. Thank you very much! Please follow these instructions carefully:

1. **Go through the [issue tracker] first!** Try to find a matching ticket. If one does not already exist, please create one, following the [Bug Report Instructions], the most important component being a recreation of the bug via JSFiddle.

2. Pull the latest code into your [fork], make your fix (following the main [Code Contribution Guidelines](Contributing-Code)) and submit a [pull request]. In your pull request, please link to the issue tracker ticket.

3. In the issue tracker ticket, link to your pull request. This allows non-contributors who care about the issue to know that progress is being made. The issue tracker ticket will serve as a central location for updates regarding the bugfix.

Going through the issue tracker and posting a recreation of the bug first helps save time, prevents the core maintainers from having to work backwards, and is more informative to others. Thank you so much for your effort!
