## Getting Help

Have a tough problem you can't figure out? Try searching the [documentation](../docs/) first. If you can't find what you're looking for, try Googling around.

If you still can't find an answer, post your question on the [StackOverflow **fullcalendar** tag](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/tagged/fullcalendar). When entering a new question, make sure you tag it with **fullcalendar**.

You can improve your chances of getting an answer if you clearly describe your situation and post code examples using tools like [JSFiddle](http://jsfiddle.net/). Here are some JSFiddle templates to help you get started:
